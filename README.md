# Coursera_Data_Science_Specialization_Notes

This repo will serve as a home location for a 'Restarter's Guide' to the Coursera Data Science Specialization courses for me. I spent a greal deal of time going progressing through courses during my summer vacation last year and felt fairly comfortable with the knowledge I had gained by mid-September. However, now that I am attempting to resume where I left off, I am finding that there are conceptual and procedural gaps that must be filled in (if you don't use it, you lose it I suppose). So, to add to my technical writing skills as well as aid in my re-learning of many R features and functions, I am going to create course notes for each course as I sift through the information. Hopefully that will help it stick better this time should I encounter another gap in my time spent using the software.
